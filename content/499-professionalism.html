            <h2>Professionalism and Working with Others</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>An major outcome of our program and degrees is that students learn to work professionally with others. This is consistently among the most important qualities that employers tell us they are seeking from graduates.</p>

            <p>In order to help develop this professionalism, in past semesters, students have been expected to work with others on their projects. While this is still encouraged, there are many logistical considerations that have made this difficult. So, while you may be working individually on your own project, you will be expected to help and lift others working on their projects.</p>

            <p>For many years, students in the face-to-face version of senior project have met weekly, and as part of their meeting, they have given a short report to everyone in their section about their projects and their progress during the previous week. These students have consistently cited this as a very valuable process in helping them stay on track, as well as a great opportunity to network with others, and see the awesome things they are doing.</p>

            <p>This experience is now extended to all senior project students, face-to-face and online, through project cohorts.</p>

            <h3>Project Cohorts</h3>

            <p>Because it would not be feasible for every student keep up with every other student's progress, you will be assigned to a project cohort of 10 students. You will be responsible to share your progress with them, and help and encourage others as possible in their projects. Sometimes this is as simple as asking a question or giving encouragement, but sometimes, you will have knowledge about a certain topic that others are researching that you can share.</p>

            <h4>Slack</h4>
            <p>To help coordinate general senior project course discussion and also work of the project cohorts, a Slack organization has been created for senior projects. All students should join this organization, and the #general channel can be used for course-wide discussion. Then, a private channel will be created for each of the project cohorts. This is where most of the communication will occur.</p>

            <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <p>As a part of your senior project experience, you will be expected to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Be a good participant in the general channel of the course.</p></li>
                <li><p>Provide brief status updates</p></li>
                <li><p>Share what you are researching and learning about</p></li>
                <li><p>Share what you are creating</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is not designed to require a significant amount of time, but rather, just a few minutes each week.</p>

            <h4>Participating in the General Channel Discussion</h4>
            <p>This should be self-explanatory--just be a respectful participant in the discussions in the general channel. There is no specific requirement on frequency of posting, etc.</p>

            <h4>Weekly Status Updates</h4>
            <p>In addition to submitting a more detailed status report to the instructor, each week you need to give a very brief status report to the rest of the cohort. For this update, you should share:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>What your project is</p></li>
                <li><p>How many hours you worked that week</p></li>
                <li><p>What you have been working on</p>
                <li><p>What you plan to do the next week</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Again, this update should be brief, and could be a single post to your cohort Slack channel, such as:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="quote">I am working on the 3D world simulator. This week I spent about 12 hours, and made good progress getting my local environment configured and set up. Next week, I hope to be able to see spheres showing up on the screen, even if they are not moving yet.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>You don't have to respond to everyone else's post, but you should read through them and offer a suggestion if you have one, such as:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p class="quote">Hey @sburton, I have done a little bit with 3D rendering, so if you get stuck with the software, let me know.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Sharing what you are learning</h4>
            <p>During the first half of the project, much of your time will be spent researching and learning new things. At least once during the first half of the project, you need to share something with the class about one of the topics you are learning about. This should be a 5-10 minute video presentation.</p>

            <p>When you have prepared your presentation, upload a link to it to the cohort Slack channel. Feel free to respond to other people's posts about what they are learning, but you are not required to respond to every one of them.</p>

            <p>For full-semester students, this must be completed by the midterm of the semester. And for Part A students, this must be completed before the end of Part A.</p>

            <h4>Sharing what you are creating</h4>
            <p>At some point during the second half of you project, you need to share with your cohort a short demonstration of what you are creating. This does not have to be a polished presentation, and your project does not have to be completing working when you demonstrate, but rather, this is just a chance to show everyone what you have been doing in a little more detail than what you post each week.</p>

            <p>As with your presentation about what you are learning, you should prepare a 5-10 minute video to demonstrate your project, or some component of it, with your cohort. Please post a link to this video in your cohort Slack channel.</p>

            <p>This presentation must be completed before the end of the semester for either full-semester or Part B students.</p>

            <h3>Grading and Assessment</h3>
            <p>It is expected that each student will complete the above requirements. Each of the two presentations, and general participation each week are considered pass/fail. Failure to complete either presentation, or be active each week will result in a third of a grade reduction for each area (e.g., a drop from a B to a B-), or a full letter grade for no participation.</p>
