            <h2>CS 499 - Course Information and Syllabus</h2>

            <p>Welcome to Senior Project!</p>
            <p>This is an exciting time because it represents that you have arrived at the level of completing a major capstone project. This course is designed to be very much an independent, student-driven process. In a nutshell, you decide what you want to learn and build and then go do it.</p>
            <p>The role of the instructor in this course is simply to help mentor you through the project and ensure that you complete what you planned.</p>
            <p>There obviously have to be some guidelines in place, but these are designed to be as minimal as possible. This document will outline the steps you need to complete.</p>

            <div class="notes">
            <p>Please note that this is version 2.1 of this document and is the current standard. Versions <a href="499-information-version20.html">2.0</a> and <a href="499-information-version1.html">1.0</a> have been deprecated, but can still be used by students who began their process with the old standard in mind.</p>

            <h3>Outcomes and Expectations</h3>

            <p>The outcome of the senior project course is that you learn something new and demonstrate that you have learned it by applying that topic to complete a significant project.
            </p>
            <p>In previous semesters, the major emphasis has been on choosing an emphasis that is completely new to you, and starting from scratch to learn its fundamentals.
            </p>
            <p>While it is still critical for you to learn and apply concepts that are new to you, the emphasis has shifted to the project being <em>significant</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The expectation is that "significant" projects:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Use existing code wherever possible.</span> As in the real world, you should take advantage of any existing libraries or codebases and bring these together to build something more involved than you could if you started from scratch.</p></li>
                <!-- <li><p><span class="topic-name">Are completed in teams.</span> Senior projects should normally be completed in teams. This allows you to build something larger and more complete than you could on your own.</p></li> -->
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Are often completed in teams.</span> Senior projects can, but are not required to, be completed in teams. This allows you to build something larger and more complete than you could on your own.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Are completed.</span> This sounds obvious at the beginning, but many students question it at the end. You will set the expectations for what your project requires and be expected to complete it.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Have potential real-world impact.</span> Your project should solve a real-world problem or address a real need. This could range from a service offering to benefit the disabled or underprivileged or could be a business idea that you would like to further develop after the course, or anywhere in between. But the idea is that it should provide value.</p></li>
                <!-- <li><p><span class="topic-name">Can be demonstrated.</span> As a part of your project, you will be expected to present it at the Research and Creative Works conference and/or create a video to demonstrate it for the course YouTube channel. You should be able to convince others of its <em>significance</em>.</p></li> -->
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Build your portfolio/resume.</span> You project should be something you can put on your resume that will impress prospective employers.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Require a full semesterâ€™s level of effort.</span> Your senior project should require the level of effort of a 3 credit, senior-level CS course. The university recommends spending 2 hours outside of class for every hour in class, or 9 hours per week devoted to a 3 credit course. With that in mind, each team member should plan to work roughly 126 hours on the project (9 hours multiplied by 14 weeks). Please keep in mind that while we will track hours spent, completing a great project is the goal, not spending lots of time.</p></li>

            </ul>

            <p>Please note that a research-related project/paper can also be significant, and is a great option for students considering graduate school.</p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>

            <p>The senior project is designed to be as independent as possible. However, to help the instructor mentor you through the project, there are a certain steps you need to complete along the way.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p><a href="#idea">Choose an idea (and potentially teammates)</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="#proposal">Submit a project proposal</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="#requirements">Submit a requirements specification</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="#status-reports">Submit weekly status reports</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="#completion">Demonstrate project completion</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="#reflection">Submit a reflection document</a></p></li>
            </ol>


            <h4>Demonstrating Professionalism and Helping Others to Succeed</h4>
            <p>In addition to working on your own project, you are also expected to demonstrate professionalism and help others succeed in their projects. In addition to these instructions about the requirements of the project itself, <strong>please also read</strong> the separate <a href="./499-professionalism.html" taret="_blank">CS 499 Professionalism</a> expectations.</p>

<!-- 
            <a name="team"></a>
            <h3>Team Recommendation</h3>
            <p>As noted above, senior projects are normally completed in teams. Teams of size 3 are typically best, because as they get larger than that, it often becomes difficult to break the task up into that many pieces that can be done in parallel.</p>

            <p>If there is a compelling reason, senior projects can be completed individually, but must be approved by the instructor.</p>

            <p>Please use the discussion forum in I-Learn, Slack, or other similar means to identify people and ideas.</p>

            <p>As you form a team, you should also identify an idea or two that you think could be interesting projects and present these to the instructor. This will help you get feedback before the official proposal.</p>

            <p>Each member of the team should submit to I-learn a document with the names of the potential team members and an idea or two you are considering.</p>
 -->
            <a name="idea"></a>
            <h3>Choosing an idea (and potentially teammates)</h3>
            <p>The first step in the senior project process is to come up with an idea. The most important qualification for an idea is that the project is something that <em>you</em> are interested in. The best way to doom a project to failure is to choose an idea that you aren't passionate about. Every project will have challenges that arise along the way, but if you're working on something you are intrinsically excited about, it will be much easier to push through the hard times and be successful.</p>

            <p>As you start thinking about your focus and potential applications, you are encouraged to be in contact with your instructor to ensure that the ideas you are pursuing will meet the requirements of the course. There is no assignment or official submission process for this "pre-proposal" stage, please feel free to correspond via email, slack, or in person. It is recommended to get your main idea pre-approved before completing your formal proposal.</p>

            <a name="proposal"></a>
            <h3>Project Proposal</h3>
            <p>Your project proposal is your first chance to formally define what you plan to build. It is understood and expected that you do not know everything about your focus or your application at this point, but you should have completed some preliminary research. You will continue to research and define more specific requirements after this point. However, at this stage of the process, you should have a sufficiently clear understanding of the area to know what you want to do.</p>

            <p>At this point, you should be able to clearly articulate your focus and your application and give a 30 second elevator pitch to anyone who says, "What are you doing for your senior project?"</p>

            <p>The proposal gives you and your instructor a chance to discuss your project in concrete terms and determine that it can be an acceptable project.</p>

            <h4>The Proposal Document</h4>
            <p>The project proposal should have the following sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Contact information</span> (for all team members, if applicable).</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Abstract</span></p>
                    <p>Provide a brief summary of your project. A few sentences should suffice since you will provide details below.</p>

<!--                     <p>Note that the focus must be a Computer Science / Software Engineering topic and something not covered in your curriculum. The focus is the general principle you will be researching (e.g., image processing). The application of the focus is the product you will create that demonstrates the understanding you have gained from that research (e.g., facial recognition). Do not confuse focus and application. You will provide additional detail below.</p>
 -->                
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Background</span><p>
                    <p>Provide information essential to understanding your project. If applicable, this should include:</p>
                    <ul>
<!--                         <li><p>Definitions</p></li>
 -->                        <li><p>Prior work by others - Are you recreating something that has been done before? Are you building on top of others' work?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Prior work by you - Have you already done things in this area, and you are adding to it?</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Description</span></p>
                    <p>Provide the details of your project. In particular, make sure to include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Description - In more detail than your abstract, explain what your will project do.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Target Audience - Describe the intended audience of the project.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Success criteria - Provide a clear description of what constitutes success for your project. You will define this in more detail later in your requirements document. But it's important to be thinking of what completion will require.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Scope - Clearly define the boundary separating what is included in your project and what is not included.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Significance</span></p>
                    <p>Referring back to the expectations for significant projects above, explain how/why your project will be significant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">New Computer Science Concepts</span></p>
                    <p>Another critical part of your senior project is that you demonstrate that you have learned how to learn. Please describe the new things you will need to learn to complete this project. These items should be computer science / software engineering topics.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><span class="topic-name">Interestingness</span></p>
                    <p>Describe why this project is interesting and exciting to you. Senior projects get hard, hit road-blocks, and cause people to want to quit. If you are excited about your project, this will help you push through.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Tasks and Schedule</span></p>
                    <p>Divide your project into tasks. Try to make these as meaningful as possible and more detailed than "development." For example, for an OCR project, you might have separate tasks for loading an image into the system, identifying the text region, segmenting into characters, etc.</p>
                    <p>For each task, list the start date, stop date, and estimated number of hours to completion. Your schedule should include submitting the requirements specification as a milestone. Be sure to consider holidays and other events that may impact your schedule. Be realistic!</p>
                    <p>Provide the total estimated number of hours to completion.</p>
                    <p>Please note that this schedule is for your benefit and not something you will be held to for a grade, but rather something we can look at to see if we are on schedule or not.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">Required Resources with Costs</span> (if applicable)</p>
                    <p>List resources needed to complete your project. This may include hardware, software licenses, reference material, etc. Specify the estimated cost for each resource.</p>
                    <p>This is to help you recognize if there are things you'll need to buy, and if so, if that is feasible for you. In some cases the department may have limited funds to purchase equipment that can be reused for future projects. But recognize that if the department purchases equipment it will stay with the department.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="topic-name">References</span></p>
                    <p>Provide a bibliography of reference material. This section is not optional. Provide evidence of your preliminary research. These references need not be in a formal style, but they should have at a minimum titles, authors (if applicable), URLs (if applicable), and journal/conference names (if applicable).</p>
                </li>

            </ol>

            <p>When complete, submit your proposal to I-Learn for instructor feedback and approval. Then, you will continue in your research and preliminary work to prepare you to submit your requirements specification.</p>

            <p>You should complete your proposal as soon as possible, ideally within the first week or two of the semester.</p>

            <p>While you are waiting for feedback on your proposal, please continue forward with your project. When changes need to be made, they are almost always, clarifications, minor adjustments, or changes to scope, rather than a change to a completely different project.</p>

            <a name="requirements"></a>
            <h3>Requirements Specification</h3>
            <p>After your proposal is approved, you will know you are on a good path. You should then continue in research and preliminary work until you are prepared to more formally define the requirements of your project.</p>

            <p>The requirements should be functional requirements, meaning that you can demonstrate that the requirement is met by seeing it work, not by having to look at code.</p>

            <p>For this requirements specification you need to provide a list of "must have" requirements and a list of "would like to have" requirements. To complete your project <strong>you will be required to complete all of your "must have" requirements</strong>, so please plan accordingly.</p>

            <p>Please note that the IEEE standard is overkill for the CS 499 project requirements specification.</p>

            <p>For this document, include a paragraph or so describing the project and summarizing the requirements, then provide a list of requirements as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>A description of the requirement</p></li>
                <li><p>Success measure(s) for that requirement (i.e., how do we know that it has been met?)</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>The requirements specification is due on the date specified in your proposal. At the very latest, you should plan to have it submitted by mid-term (or by the end of 499-A if you are in that course).</p>

            <h4>Requirements Changes</h4>
            <p>You should plan to complete your project as you defined it. However, as you get deeper into your research, if you discover that something is not feasible as you had planned for some reason (note: not "a little harder than anticipated"), you may need to re-negotiate items in your proposal and/or requirements document.</p>

            <p>To request a requirements change, you should send an email to the instructor with the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>List of previous requirement(s).</p></li>
                <li><p>Explanation of why it is no long appropriate and why this was not identified earlier.</p></li>
                <li><p>List of proposed requirements to be done in lieu of the previous ones.</p></li>
                <li><p>Justification for why this change will not compromise the integrity of the overall project.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Please note that requirements changes are not made to simply make the project easier. Usually they require more work, because they require you to go in a different direction than originally planned. They are, however, necessary when the project has reached an insurmountable hurtle, so that another course of action can be taken.</p>

            <p>As with projects in the real-world, you should do all you can to identify and mitigate high priority risks as early as possible. Then, you can make plans to mitigate the risks and adjust accordingly. Also, as with the real-world, other stake holders will be much more understanding and can much more easily adjust plans the earlier in the process this happens. In other words, for this project you can expect the amount of leniency will be much greater earlier in the project. In addition, requirements cannot be changed in the last week of the semester, you should know what is possible long before that point.</p>

            <a name="status-reports"></a>
            <h3>Status Reports</h3>
            <p>Each week you submit a status report to indicate the progress you're making and list your goals for the upcoming week. Students working in teams must individually submit these status reports to discuss their specific contributions and plans.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this report is to help you gage your own progress and to help the instructor in mentoring.</p>

            <p>For status reports, download the <a href="./499-StatusReport.txt" target="_BLANK">CS 499 Status Report</a> template text file. You should fill out the sections of this text file and submit it to I-Learn. It will have you include the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Name</p></li>
                <li><p>Project Title</p></li>
                <li><p>Overall status of the project (on-schedule, behind, ahead)</p></li>
                <li><p>Number of hours A) worked that week, B) total to-date on the project, and C) anticipated total hours needed for completion.</p></li>
                <li><p>Accomplishments (since last status report)</p></li>
                <li><p>Challenges encountered (since last status report)</p></li>
                <li><p>Plans / Goals for the next week</p></li>
                <li><p>Accountability plan - What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?</p></li>
                <li><p>Other comments</p></li>
                
            </ol>

            <p>You should submit a status report each week, even before you have a proposal in place.</p>

            <a name="completion"></a>
            <h3>Project Completion</h3>
            
            <p>Before the end of the semester, you need to demonstrate your project to your instructor as defined in your proposal and requirements specification.</p>
            <p>This means you need to schedule a time to meet with the instructor (either in-person or a video call) before the end of the day on the last regular class day of the semester. This leaves the "final exam" days for you to submit your reflection document and for the instructor to finish the paperwork process.</p>

            <a name="peer-evaluation"></a>
            <h3>Peer Evaluation for Team Projects</h3>
            <p>If you completed your project in a team, at the end of the semester, please submit a document that discusses each team member's contribution.</p>

            <p>First, list the project name and the name of each team member. Then, for yourself and each member of the team include the following:</p> 

            <ol>
                <li><p>Describe this person's primary responsibilities</p></li>
                <li><p>Describe how well they fulfilled their tasks.</p></li>
                <li><p>Describe how well they communicated with the team.</p></li>
                <li><p>Describe one thing they could have done better.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Then, finally, please assign each team member a score that defines their overall contribution to the team. These scores must have an average of 10, and <strong>cannot</strong> all be the same. So, for example, you must have at least one 11 and one 9.</p>


            <a name="reflection"></a>
            <h3>Reflection Document</h3>
            <p>After completing your project, prepare and submit a reflection document covering the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Briefly describe your project.</p></li>
                <li><p>How did you meet, exceed, or fall short of your original expectations?</p></li>
                <li><p>What changes were made to your project during the process?</p></li>
                <li><p>What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the new computer science topics you learned about?</p></li>
                <li><p>What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the project itself?</p></li>
                <li><p>What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about yourself?</p></li>
                <li><p>Final Thoughts</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Grading</h3>
            <p>The university has defined the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system" target="_BLANK">grading sytem</a> to be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>"A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.</p></li>
                <li><p>"B" represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material that would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school, or employment. The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.</p></li>
                <li><p>"C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.</p></li>
                <li><p>"D" represents poor performance and initiative to learn, understand, and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.</p></li>
                <li><p>"F" represents failure in the course.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>In accordance with these definitions, the senior project will be evaluated holistically according to the following guidelines.</p>

            <p>Assuming status reports, proposal, requirements specification, and reflection document have been completed satisfactorily, then the following scale will define the grade for the course:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>A - All "must have" requirements are completed and many of the "nice to have" requirements are also in place.</p></li>
                <li><p>B - All "must have" requirements are completed.</p></li>
                <li><p>C - Some "must have" requirements are not complete but the general idea of the project is in place and the new computer science topics can be demonstrated to some degree.</p></li>
                <li><p>D - Minimal evidence of the requirements is demonstrated.</p></li>
                <li><p>F - No evidence of the requirements can be demonstrated.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Failure to submit status reports, significantly late proposals or requirements specification, or limited number of hours for the senior project will reduce the grade from the scale noted.</p>


            <p>Also, please note that failure to complete the <a href="499-professionalism.html" target="_blank">professionalism requirements</a> can reduce the final grade up to one letter grade.</p>

            <h3>CS 499-A and 499-B</h3>

            <p>For those students enrolled in CS 499-A or CS 499-B, rather than completing the project in one semester, the overall process is the same. However the expected deliverables are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>CS 499-A (2 credits)</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Roughly 84 hours</strong> (2/3 of the overall amount)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Status Updates</p></li>
                    <li><p>Proposal</p></li>
                    <li><p>Requirements Specification</p></li>
                    <li><p>Peer evaluation, if applicable</p></li>
                </ul>

                <li><p>CS 499-B (1 credit)</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Roughly 42 hours (1/3 of the overall amount)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Status Updates</p></li>
                    <li><p>Project Completion</p></li>
                    <li><p>Reflection Document</p></li>
                    <li><p>Peer evaluation, if applicable</p></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p class="faq">Can I start on my senior project before I am registered for the course?</p>
            <p>Yes! You are encouraged to get started thinking about and even working on your project before you are enrolled in the course.</p>

            <p>Please be aware that you must go through the same process of submitting proposals, status reports, etc. If you are not yet enrolled in the course, these should be submitted via email. Once you have an approved proposal, you are should submit status reports via email whenever you have done about 10 hours of work. You must be enrolled in CS 499 during the semester that you <strong>complete</strong> the project.</p>

            <p class="faq">Can I use software written by others?</p>
            <p>Yes! Your goal is to build on this code to make something significant. This usually means that you are building on top of existing components.</p>

            <p class="faq">Can my senior project be something I'm doing at work?</p>
            <p>If a project for work meets the necessary requirements, it can potentially be used for a senior project. However, it is important that to go through the process of proposal, requirements document, and status reports <strong>before</strong> undertaking the project.</p>

            <p class="faq">Can I use something I have previously done for my senior project?</p>

            <p>As a matter of policy, previously completed projects, either for work or personal projects, are <strong>not</strong> eligible for senior project credit. Regardless of what you have done previously, there is still more to learn. The purpose of the senior project is for you to learn something new--so, even if you have done great things in the past, choose something new and interesting to you and see what you can learn.</p>

            <p>You are welcome to add onto previous projects, provided the new work will cause you do learn new computer science concepts and be significant.</p>

            <p class="faq">Can my senior project be something I'm doing for my internship?</p>
            
            <p>Projects done as part of an internship are being counted as part of that course and are not eligible to double count as senior projects.</p>

            <p class="faq">What are some possibilities topics for my project?</p>
            <p>You need to decide what <em>you</em> are interested in, so it will be a meaningful project for you.</p>

<!--             <p>However, the following is a list of potential ideas that students have done in the past. It is not comprehensive and not it any order.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>grad school research area (BYU, USU, UI)</li>
                <li>computer graphics (if you haven't taken CS 312)</li>
                <li>machine learning / neural nets (if you haven't taken CS 450-if you have, we can still talk and potentially find something deeper in this vast space) </li>
                <li>computer / network security (if you haven't taken CS 470)</li>
                <li>bioinformatics</li>
                <li>artificial intelligence / genetic algorithms</li>
                <li>concurrent / parallel computing</li>
                <li>distributed operating systems / applications</li>
                <li>embedded computing</li>
                <li>real-time programming</li>
                <li>machine vision / image processing</li>
                <li>cooperative effort with an ECEN senior project</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="faq">Are there some topics I should avoid?</p>
            <p>Games. It is hard to impress a potential employer with a game that you have spent 100 hours on, when they will compare it to polished products that have had thousands and thousands of hours of work.</p>
