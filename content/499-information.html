            <h1>CS 499 - Course Information, Scheule, and Syllabus</h1>

            <p>Welcome to Senior Project!</p>
            <p>This is an exciting time because it represents that you have arrived at the level of completing a major capstone project. This course is designed to be very much an independent, student-driven process. In a nutshell, you decide what you want to learn and build and then go do it.</p>
            <p>The role of the instructor in this course is simply to help mentor you through the project and ensure that you complete what you planned.</p>
            <p>There obviously have to be some guidelines in place, but these are designed to be as minimal as possible. This document will outline the steps you need to complete.</p>

            <a name="outcomes"></a>
            <h2>Outcomes and Requirements</h2>
            <p>The outcome of the senior project course is that you learn something new and demonstrate that you have learned it by applying that topic to complete a significant project.</p>

            <p>Looking at this statement more deeply, we can observe the following:</p>

            <h3>1. Learn something new</h3>
            <p>One of the program outcomes of our degree is that students learn how to learn. As a capstone experience, the senior project allows you to demonstrate that you have developed the ability to independently learn and apply new concepts.</p>

            <p>To demonstrate this, you will choose a focus for your project  that must be "outside of your curriculum. In other words, you need to choose something that is different than what you have learned or done (or could have naturally done) in one of your other classes. This is critical to demonstrate that you truly can independent learn something new. There is no requirement that this has to be novel research (i.e., novel to the world), but it needs to be new to you.</p>

            <h3>2. Application</h3>
            <p>After selecting a focus for your project, you will then select an application of this focus, which will enable you to demonstrate your competency in this area. This is usually a software product that you write.</p>

            <p>A common mistake is to decide on an application first, and then try to define a focus from it. Often someone says they have a great project in mind and they are just trying to determine a focus from it. This is not the right approach, because often the application in mind ends up being only tangentially related to the focus, whereas another application would be a better fit for it.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the application must allow you to outwardly demonstrate the focus (i.e., without having to look at the code).</p>

            <h3>3. Significance</h3>
            <p>Your senior project should be a significant project--something you can be proud of and use to impress potential employers.</p>

            <p>Assuming a budget of 3 hours outside of class for every hour in class, for this 3 credit class you should be spending 12 hours per week or 156 hours during the semester on your project (12 hours * 13 weeks. We actually plan courses with 14-week semester plans, but that does not take into account holidays.)</p>

            <h3>4. Completion</h3>
            <p>You must complete your project for it to be complete. This sounds obvious now, but often at the end of the semester, students question this point. Keep in mind that you will set your own requirements and deliverables. Then, you will need to demonstrate that you have completed the requirements.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>The senior project is designed to be as independent as possible. However, to help the instructor mentor you through the project, there are a certain steps you need to complete along the way.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><a href="#proposal">Submit a project proposal</a></li>
                <li><a href="#requirements">Submit a requirements specification</a></li>
                <li><a href="#status-reports">Submit weekly status reports</a></li>
                <li><a href="#completion">Demonstrate project completion</a></li>
                <li><a href="#reflection">Submit a reflection document</a></li>
            </ol>

            <a name="proposal"></a>
            <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
            <div class="scripture">And make proposals for peace unto those who have smitten you,
            according to the voice of the Spirit which is in you,
            and all things shall work together for your good.
            <div class="reference">D&amp;C 105:40</div></div>

            <p>Your project proposal is your first chance to formally define what you plan to build. It is understood and expected that you do not know everything about your focus or your application at this point, but you should have completed some preliminary research. You will continue to research and define more specific requirements after this point, however, at this stage of the process, you should have a sufficiently clear understanding of the area to know what you want to do.</p>

            <p>At this point, you should be able to clearly articulate your focus and your application and give a 30 second elevator pitch to anyone who says, "What are you doing for your senior project?"</p>

            <p>The proposal gives you and your instructor a chance to discuss your project in concrete terms and determine that it can be an acceptable project.</p>

            <p>The project proposal should have the following sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Scripture</p>
                    <p>Provide the text and reference of a relevant (canonized) scripture.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Abstract</p>
                    <p>Provide a brief summary of your project. A few sentences should suffice since you will provide details below. You must include and complete the following sentences:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>"The focus of this project is ..."</li>
                        <li>"The application of this focus is ..."</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note that the focus must be a Computer Science / Software Engineering topic and something not covered in your curriculum. The focus is the general principle you will be researching (e.g., image processing). The application of the focus is the product you will create that demonstrates the understanding you have gained from that research (e.g., facial recognition). Do not confuse focus and application. You will provide additional detail below.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Background<p>
                    <p>Provide information essential to understanding your project. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Definitions</li>
                        <li>Why this topic is of interest (to you!)</li>
                        <li>Prior work by others</li>
                        <li>Prior work by you</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Description</p>
                    <p>Provide the details of your project.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide a description of your project.</li>
                        <li>Provide a clear description of what constitutes success for your project (e.g., 90% accuracy).</li>
                        <li>Divide your project into tasks; describe each task and the method(s) you will employ for each task. The first task should be "preliminary research and proposal preparation". The second task should be "research". Since you are developing software, tasks should include requirements specification, design, and quality (such as testing).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Scope</p>
                    <p>Clearly define the boundary separating what is included in your project and what is not included.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Tasks and Schedule</p>
                    <p>For each task discussed in the description, list the start date, stop date, and estimated number of hours to completion. Your schedule should include submitting the requirements specification as a milestone. Be sure to consider holidays and other events that may impact your schedule. Be realistic!</p>
                    <p>Provide the total estimated number of hours to completion. You must have a minimum of 117 total hours. The total number of hours sets the maximum grade you can earn; it does not establish the grade you have earned. With a total of 117 hours, you will earn no more than a C. With a total of 137 hours, you will earn no more than a B. If you want to earn an A, you must have a minimum of 156 hours.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Deliverables</p>
                    <p>Provide a checklist of items that will be submitted for grading purposes at the end of your project. Since you are developing software, deliverables shall include evidence of design and source code.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Applicability</p>
                    <p>Explain how this project facilitates you integrating previously learned material. Explain (as necessary) how this project is exclusive of your computer science curriculum.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Required Resources with Costs (if applicable)</p>
                    <p>List (and describe, as appropriate) resources needed to complete your project. This includes, but is not limited to, hardware and reference material. Specify the estimated cost for each resource.</p>
                    <p>This is to help you recognize if there are things you'll need to buy, and if so, if that is feasible for you. In some cases the department may have limited funds to purchase equipment, but recognize that if the department purchases equipment it will stay with the department.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>References</p>
                    <p>Provide a bibliography of reference material. This section is not optional. Provide evidence of your preliminary research. These references need not be in a formal style, but they should have at a minimum titles, authors (if applicable), URLs (if applicable), and journal/conference names (if applicable).</p>
                </li>

            </ol>

            <p>When complete, submit your proposal to I-Learn for instructor feedback. Then you will continue in your research and preliminary work to prepare you to submit your requirements specification.</p>

            <a name="requirements"></a>
            <h2>Requirements Specification</h2>
            <p>After having your proposal approved, you will know you are on a good path. You should then continue in research and preliminary work until you are prepared to more formally define the requirements of your project.</p>

            <p>The requirements should be functional requirements, meaning that we should be able to see that it is met by seeing it work, and not having to look at code.</p>

            <p>The IEEE standard is overkill for the CS 499 project requirements specification. This is also NOT an assignment from Software Engineering I :-).</p>

            <p>For this requirements specification you need to provide a list of "must have" requirements and a list of "would like to have" requirements. You will be required to complete all of your "must have" requirements, so please plan accordingly.</p>

            <p>In your "must have" list, include at least one requirement regarding execution time. For example, "the product shall calculate the answer within one second."</p>

            <p>Format your requirements as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A requirement number (so we can use it as a unique identifier later)</li>
                <li>The functional requirement (note: if the demonstration requires reviewing code, it's not a functional requirement)</li>
                <li>Demonstration scenario(s) for that requirement</li>
                <li>Success measure(s) for that requirement</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The requirements specification is due on the date specified in your proposal.</p>

            <a name="status-reports"></a>
            <h2>Status Reports</h2>
            <p>Each week, you need to submit a status report to indicate the progress you're making and list your goals for the upcoming week.</p>

            <p>The goal of this report is to help you gage your own progress and to help the instructor in mentoring.</p>

            <p>For status reports, download the <a href="" target="_BLANK">CS 499 Status Report</a> template PDF. You should fill out the sections of this PDF and submit it to I-Learn. This PDF will have you include the following:</p>

            <h2>Project Completion</h2>
            <p>Before the end of the semester, you need to demonstrate your project to your instructor as specified in your proposal and requirements specification.</p>
            <p>This means you need to schedule a time to meet with the instructor before the end of the day on the last regular class day of the semester. This leaves the "final exam" days for you to submit your reflection document and for the instructor to finish the paperwork process.</p>
